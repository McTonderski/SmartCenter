So in this section we are going to create User interface of out Smart Home center. 

Firstly this app will only be available for windows, but there is a way to put c++ into android devices.

Basics:
What does UI needs to be able to do.

User must be able to control all the IOT devices and by control i mean:
-turning it on and off,
-scheduling it's work(setting time when device turns on and off)
-read data from sensors
-download data from db and displaying it on a graph on any data viusalisation solutioin you guys think it's the most suitable,
-app should be able to add and pair a new device, 
-Graphic design, not just a based one built in.

Database:

stores IOT devices information: type, sensor types, functionality
stores every user input,
stores data from sensors,
stroes schedule for IOT devices

Server:

So server is the brain of the action. It needs to handle multiple connections from all of the devices(however there is a way but about that later maybe you guys fiugre it out)
Server than send data to a database
handles Desktop app request,
sends signals to devices.
Details needs to be planned by teams

IOT:

This section will create devices for the projects. Starting from boards and software for them. 
Me and Filip Pawelec are going to handle it. 

That's it 
I want each team to have a talk albout any ideas that they have about the topic.
I want teams to create on git folder where they will create a file in which they describe theirs idea.

that's it for the week.
